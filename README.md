# Quiz App

This Python-based Quiz App is designed for use in an educational setting.  
It allows users to take quizzes with a limited time for each question.  
If a question is not answered within the time limit, the app automatically notifies the user and moves to the next question.  
At the end of the quiz, it calculates and displays the user's results, making it easy for students to test their knowledge and for instructors to track performance.
